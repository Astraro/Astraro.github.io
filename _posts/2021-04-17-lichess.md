title: Netflix' Queen's Gambit and Its Impact on Online Chess
---

Introduction:
------------
I learned chess when I was five years old. It didn't take long for me to beat my father and brother. Later on I joined the local chess club, became not a very strong, but an above average player and the game never lost its fascinating character. Nevertheless, in my opinion chess always had the reputation of being an activity mostly for nerds.

But in the last year things changed noticeably. Chess, especially online chess gained lots of popularity. In my opinion, there are two events responsible for this development. At first, COVID-19. People played chess online instead face to face. Moreover, very strong players like the world champion Magnus Carlsen started their own online tournaments that attract public attention. The second reason is Netflix' drama series "The Queen's Gambit". This series is about the orphan Beth who tries to become the best chess player in the world, but also struggles with drug addiction. The name Queen's Gambit comes from a popular chess opening, which is depicted in the picture above.

Here, I want to investigate the impact of Queen's Gambit on online chess by analyzing games played on <https://lichess.org/>.

Lichess is one of the most popular platforms for online chess with more 100.000 players online at the same time and also lots of the world's top players like Magnus Carlsen play there regularly. Moreover, Lichess offers the opportunity to play several different chess variants like Chess960, Crazyhouse ... and time modes.

When you play chess you usually use a chess clock. You have a main time and an increment. E.g., the time control 180+2 means, that a player has 180 seconds for the entire game and after each moves he receives addional 2 seconds. The increment has the effect that a player does not run out of time in the end. In the analysis we will consider the time modes Bullet, Blitz, Rapid and Classical. In Bullet each player has less than 3 minutes for the first 40 moves. This is a very fast time mode. To play sound chess in Bullet you have to be a very strong chess player. Blitz is the most popular time mode: Here each player has at most 8 minutes for the first 40 moves. Rapid and Classical are slower time modes, in which each player has less than or at least 25 minutes for the first 40 moves. From my personal experience stronger players prefer playing Bullet or Blitz.


Outline:
------------
We will consider the following questions to investigate the impact of "The Queen's Gambit" on online chess:
-	How did the number of games played develop?
-	Do we observe a change in the structure of players?
-	Do we also observe a boost of the popularity of the eponymous chess opening Queen's Gambit?


Procedure:
-------------
All games played on Lichess are available on <https://database.lichess.org/>. Netflix' Queen's Gambit was published on the 23rd of October. I will analyze all games played on Lichess in October and November 2020. That's a lot of data. Unpacking the data from only these two months yields text data of more than 250 gb.

Before being able to analyze the date, several data wrangling steps must be performed: The games are storen in the pgn-format. This is a format which is usually used to store chess games in databases. Therefore, I do some parsing beforehand. Then, I store the revelevant features for the analyses in a csv-file. Unfortunately, these csv-files are still very large. Hence, I didn't use pandas at this point to process the csv-files, but again we go through the files line by line. Then, we count which games belong to clusters that are useful for our analysis. This way we obtain a compressed dataframe which contains all relevant information for our analysis.

Analysis:
------------
Now, we everything prepared to consider the questions given in the introduction. We start with the development over time. The series Queen's gambit was published on 23 October. Do we see a significant change in the number of games played daily on Lichess? The answer is definitely yes as the following plot shows.

-	Eingehen auf die Spitze am 24. Oktober.
-	Lineare Regression. Vorher hatten wir im Mittel einen täglichen Anstieg von x1 Partien pro Tag. Nach der Veröffentlichung sehen wir einen Anstieg von x2 Partien pro Tag.

Now, let's take a closer look at the development of the shares of the time modes. It is important to know that stronger and more experienced player usually prefer faster time controls, that is blitz or even bullet. That is no surprise, since beginner usually have to think longer about their moves. We have seen that the numbers of games played increased significantly after the publishing of the Queen's gambit. In my opinion it is likely that there is an increase in many new and weaker players. Therefore, I would expect that the shares of bullet and blitz decrease, but the shares of rapid and classical increase. Is this right?

It seems that I'm not mistaken. But what really interesting is the outlier in blitz on October 24. At the day after the release the share of the games in blitz increased for one day dramatically. My hypothesis would be that many new players started playing on Lichess at this day, and blitz might be the time mode that a player chooses at first before recognizing that it is a bit too fast in the beginning.

We have seen that the Netflix series had clearly an impact on the number of games played on Lichess and also on the mixture of time modes. But does also the opening, which is eponymous for the series, gains more popularity? The answer is yes, but the effect is very small.

Summary and further questions:
------------------------
We investigated the impact of Netflix' Queen's gambit on online chess by analyzing the games played on the online platform Lichess in October and November 20. We have seen that there is a quite remarkable effect. Moreover, we noticed that there also exists an impact on the shares of different time modes. My hypothesis is that the reason is a large number of beginners joining Lichess at this point in time. But it would be worth considering this point in more details, e.g., using the Lichess API to evaluate profile data of each player.

Moreover, it would be interesting to extend the above analysis to the entire year 2020 to measure the effect of COVID-19 in more detail. I would expect that there exists another dramatic increase in March and April.
